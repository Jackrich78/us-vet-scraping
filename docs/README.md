## Overview

This project uses AI agents to maintain comprehensive, up-to-date documentation. All features follow structured workflows with planning documentation created before implementation.

## System Documentation

Core technical documentation for the project:

- **[Architecture Overview](system/architecture.md)** - System design and components
- **[Database Schema](system/database.md)** - Data model and migrations
- **[API Specifications](system/api.md)** - Endpoints and contracts
- **[External Integrations](system/integrations.md)** - Services, MCPs, and third-party APIs
- **[Technology Stack](system/stack.md)** - Languages, frameworks, tools, and versions

## Standard Operating Procedures

How we work - standards enforced by agents:

- **[SOP Template](sop/sop-template.md)** - How to write SOPs
- **[Git Workflow](sop/git-workflow.md)** - Branching, commits, and PRs
- **[Testing Strategy](sop/testing-strategy.md)** - TDD approach and test levels
- **[Code Style](sop/code-style.md)** - Code quality and formatting standards
- **[Lessons Learned](sop/mistakes.md)** - Documented mistakes and prevention
- **[GitHub Setup](sop/github-setup.md)** - Repository configuration guide

## Templates

Document templates used by agents (in `templates/` directory):

- **prd-template.md** - Product Requirements Document
- **research-template.md** - Research findings and recommendations
- **architecture-template.md** - Architecture decisions and comparison
- **acceptance-template.md** - Acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then)
- **testing-template.md** - Test strategy and test stubs
- **manual-test-template.md** - Human testing instructions

## Workflow Commands

Use these slash commands to work with documentation:

### Active Commands (Phase 1)
- `/explore [topic]` - Start feature exploration, creates PRD and research
- `/plan [FEAT-ID]` - Create planning docs (architecture, acceptance, testing)
- `/update-docs` - Regenerate this index, validate links, update CHANGELOG

### Coming in Phase 2
- `/build [FEAT-ID]` - Implement feature based on plans
- `/test [FEAT-ID]` - Run tests and validate implementation
- `/commit [message]` - Git workflow with validation

## Documentation Standards

### Phase 1: Planning Documentation

All features require these 6 documents before implementation:

1. **PRD (prd.md)**: Problem, goals, user stories, scope
2. **Research (research.md)**: Findings, recommendations, sources
3. **Architecture (architecture.md)**: Options, comparison, decision
4. **Acceptance (acceptance.md)**: Given/When/Then criteria
5. **Testing (testing.md)**: Test strategy, test stubs
6. **Manual Test (manual-test.md)**: Human testing guide

### Quality Criteria

- ✅ All required sections present
- ✅ Templates followed exactly
- ✅ Word limits respected (≤800 words per doc)
- ✅ No TODO or placeholder content (except test stubs)
- ✅ Acceptance criteria in Given/When/Then format
- ✅ Test stubs created in tests/ directory
- ✅ Reviewer agent validation passed

### Auto-Updated Files

These files are automatically maintained by agents:

- **docs/README.md** (this file) - Regenerated by `/update-docs`
- **AC.md** - Appended during `/plan` command
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Updated by Documenter agent

### Manual Files

These require human curation:

- Root **README.md** - Project overview
- **CLAUDE.md** - Agent orchestration
- **docs/system/** - Architecture documentation
- **docs/sop/** - Standard operating procedures

## Archive

Completed or deprecated features move to `docs/archive/` to keep this index clean.

*No archived features yet*
