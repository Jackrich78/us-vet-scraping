# Product Requirements Document: Example Feature

**Feature ID:** FEAT-001
**Status:** Example (Template Demonstration)
**Created:** 2025-10-24
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-24

## Problem Statement

This is an example feature that demonstrates the complete AI workflow process from exploration through planning. It shows how documentation should be structured, what level of detail is expected, and how different planning documents connect together. This example helps developers understand the workflow before implementing real features.

## Goals & Success Criteria

### Primary Goals
- Demonstrate complete feature documentation structure
- Show relationship between PRD, research, architecture, and testing docs
- Provide reference for agents to follow when creating real feature documentation

### Success Metrics
- Developers can replicate this structure for real features
- Agents use this as reference for documentation formatting
- All required sections are demonstrated clearly

## User Stories

### Story 1: Developer Learns Workflow
**As a** developer new to this template
**I want** a complete example feature to reference
**So that** I understand what good feature documentation looks like

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All 6 planning documents are present and complete
- [ ] Documents follow templates exactly
- [ ] Cross-references between docs are clear
- [ ] Example is realistic enough to be instructive

### Story 2: Agent Follows Pattern
**As an** AI agent
**I want** a reference implementation to learn from
**So that** I can generate documentation that meets quality standards

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Documentation structure is clear and consistent
- [ ] All required sections are present
- [ ] Word limits are respected
- [ ] Format is easy to parse and replicate

### Story 3: User Validates Planning
**As a** product owner or stakeholder
**I want** to see complete planning documentation
**So that** I can approve feature implementation with confidence

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Requirements are clear and testable
- [ ] Architecture decision is justified
- [ ] Testing approach is comprehensive
- [ ] Manual testing can be performed by non-technical users

## Scope & Non-Goals

### In Scope
- Complete demonstration of all 6 planning documents
- Following all templates and SOPs
- Showing realistic content (not just placeholders)
- Demonstrating test stub generation

### Out of Scope (For This Example)
- Actual feature implementation (this is Phase 1, planning only)
- Real code files (only test stubs)
- Integration with real services
- Production deployment considerations

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- This is a documentation-only example (no code implementation in Phase 1)
- Must work with generic template (no stack-specific details)
- Should remain relevant as project evolves

### Business Constraints
- Example must be simple enough to understand quickly
- Complex enough to show all documentation aspects
- Self-contained (doesn't require external context)

### Assumptions
- Users have basic software development knowledge
- Users understand the purpose of planning documentation
- This example will be referenced by agents and developers

## Open Questions

1. **Should example be more technical or more business-focused?**
   - Why it matters: Affects which aspects of documentation are emphasized
   - Who can answer: Users of this template will provide feedback

2. **Should we create multiple examples for different project types?**
   - Why it matters: Different stacks may need different examples
   - Who can answer: Determined by user feedback in Phase 2/3

3. **How detailed should test stubs be in the example?**
   - Why it matters: Balance between instructive and overly complex
   - Who can answer: Review after initial template usage

## Related Context

### Existing Features
- This is FEAT-001, the first feature in the template
- Serves as foundation for all future features

### References
- All documentation templates in `docs/templates/`
- All SOPs in `docs/sop/`
- CLAUDE.md orchestration rules

**Next Steps:**
1. Researcher agent investigates best practices for example documentation
2. After research completes, proceed to planning with `/plan FEAT-001`

**Note:** This example demonstrates the exploration phase output. In a real feature, the PRD would describe an actual feature to implement.
