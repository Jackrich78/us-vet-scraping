# Testing Strategy: Example Feature

**Feature ID:** FEAT-001
**Created:** 2025-10-24

## Overview

This example demonstrates testing strategy documentation. In a real feature, this would list specific test files, test cases, and coverage goals.

## Test Files

In a real feature, test stubs would be created in `tests/` directory following the testing strategy outlined here.

**Example structure:**
```
tests/
└── features/
    └── example/
        ├── example.test.ts
        └── example.integration.test.ts
```

**Note:** This is an example demonstrating documentation structure, not an actual feature with tests.
