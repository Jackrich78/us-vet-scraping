# Research Archive (October 2025)

**Archived Date:** 2025-10-24
**Reason:** Initial project research completed during template creation

## Purpose

This archive contains research documents created during the initial development of the AI Workflow Starter template itself. These documents informed the design and structure of the template system but are not part of the template's operational documentation.

## Contents

- **archon.md** - Research on Archon MCP integration patterns
- **doc-structure.md** - Documentation structure research and best practices
- **sub-agents-slash.md** - Research on Claude Code sub-agent architecture and slash command workflows

## Context

These research documents were created to inform the design of:
- The 5 active sub-agents (Explorer, Researcher, Planner, Documenter, Reviewer)
- The 6 slash commands (/explore, /plan, /update-docs, plus Phase 2 stubs)
- The documentation structure in docs/features/, docs/system/, docs/sop/
- The optional Archon MCP integration strategy
- The hook system for session recovery and automation

## Status

These documents served their purpose and are archived for historical reference. They are not actively maintained and should not be modified.

## For Template Users

If you cloned this template for your own project, you may safely delete this archive folder. It contains meta-research about the template itself, not documentation for using the template.

## Related Documentation

For current template usage, see:
- [Main README](../../../README.md) - Template overview and quick start
- [CLAUDE.md](../../../CLAUDE.md) - Agent system and workflows
- [docs/README.md](../../README.md) - Documentation index

**Archive:** This folder is for historical reference only and not part of active template documentation.
