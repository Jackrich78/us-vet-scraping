CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. The "personalization_context" field is ESSENTIAL (flat array, not nested) - find at least 2-3 unique, specific facts about this practice that could be conversation starters for a cold call.
2. For vet_count_total, count individual veterinarians (DVMs) listed on team/staff pages. Be conservative - only report if confident. Better to return null than guess incorrectly.
3. For vet_count_confidence, use: "high" (explicit list with names), "medium" (count mentioned in text), "low" (inferred from context).
4. For decision_maker, look for titles like "Owner", "Practice Owner", "Practice Manager", "Hospital Administrator", "Managing Director".
5. Extract ACTUAL names when possible, not generic titles.
6. Return null for any field where information is not found - do not guess or hallucinate.
7. For services and technology, only mark as true if explicitly mentioned or clearly visible on the website.
8. Personalization context should be SPECIFIC and UNIQUE to this practice, not generic facts that apply to all vets.
9. "awards_accreditations" should list AAHA accreditation, Fear Free Certification, and awards.
10. "recent_news_updates" should capture news from the last 12 months (new locations, expansions, major investments).
11. "community_involvement" should note charity partnerships, rescue support, school programs, local event sponsorships.
12. "practice_philosophy" should extract mission statements or "our approach" sections (max 500 chars).
