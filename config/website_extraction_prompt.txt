CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. The "personalization_context.unique_facts" field is ESSENTIAL - find at least 2-3 unique, specific facts about this practice that could be conversation starters for a cold call.
2. For vet_count, count individual veterinarians listed on team/staff pages. Be conservative - only report if confident. Better to return null than guess incorrectly.
3. For decision_maker, look for titles like "Owner", "Practice Owner", "Practice Manager", "Hospital Administrator", "Managing Director".
4. Extract ACTUAL names when possible, not generic titles.
5. Return null for any field where information is not found - do not guess or hallucinate.
6. For services and technology, only mark as true if explicitly mentioned or clearly visible on the website.
7. Personalization context should be SPECIFIC and UNIQUE to this practice, not generic facts that apply to all vets.

Examples of GOOD personalization context:
- "Opened in 1952, family-owned for 3 generations"
- "Dr. Johnson was named Boston Magazine Best Vet 2024"
- "Only practice in Greater Boston specializing in avian medicine"
- "Recently invested $2M in new surgical suite (opened March 2024)"
- "Sponsors the Boston Animal Rescue League"

Examples of BAD personalization context (too generic):
- "They care about animals"
- "Friendly staff"
- "Good reviews"
- "Offers veterinary services"
